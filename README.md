=============

C# .Net console app to monitor apple dev center status web page

Quick & dirty console app to monitor the apple system status page.
I was only interested in a few systems, so more can be added if you need more than the 4 provided.
I used a custom email provider, so if you want email, there is a placeholder section so you can provide your own code there.
